Hi, I'm Shivam! I am a Research Engineer at the University of California at Berkeley EECS in Prof. Preeya Khanna's Lab. I work on invasive brain-computer interfaces on non-human primates to understand the hand motor cortex.

Previously, I was a senior postgraduate student in Cognitive Science at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar. I worked on decoding brain states using machine learning and deep learning approaches from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. I have also worked on building a cable-driven upper-limb exoskeleton. I have a bachelor's in Computer Science and have worked as a full-stack software developer.

In the future, I wish to pursue a PhD in invasive brain-computer interfaces to understand hand/leg motion and related fields.
