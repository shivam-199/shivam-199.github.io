Hi, I'm Shivam! I am a senior postgraduate student in Cognitive Science at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar. I work on decoding brain states using machine learning and deep learning approaches from electroencephalograpy (EEG) signals. I have worked on building a cable-driven upper-limb exoskeleton. I have a bachelor's in Computer Science and have worked as a full stack software developer.

I work in Computational Neuroscience specializing in brain-computer interfaces. In my master's thesis, I am working on building a real-time brain-computer interface for grasp open vs. close classification. I wish to pursue a PhD in invasive/non-invasive neural prosthetics.
