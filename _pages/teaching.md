1. I was invited by Prof. Krishna Prasad Miyapuram and Dr. Pankaj Pandey to take a lecture on event-related potentials (ERPs) used in EEG signal processing for the course of "Computation and Cognition" at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar in Fall 2023.

2. I was invited by the EETI foundation to give an introductory talk on brain-computer interfaces. The session was conducted online and was attended by around 100 enthusiastic students (since gmeet only allows 100). You can find a recording of the lecture [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsqhXmrKhY&t=1310s).

3. I was invited by Prof. Krishna Prasad Miyapuram to take a lecture on EEG signal processing to decode brain states using feature extraction and machine learning approaches for the course of "Computational Neuroscience" at the the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar in Spring 2023.
